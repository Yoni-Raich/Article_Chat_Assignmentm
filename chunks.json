Paltrow was, of course, previously married to Coldplay singer Chris Martin. And it was at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts that the company\u2019s CEO Andy Byron and chief people officer Kristin Cabot were apparently caught dancing together on the \u201ckiss cam.\u201d When Byron and Cabot (who are reportedly married to other people) awkwardly tried to hide from the camera, Martin joked, \u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy.\u201d Footage of the exchange exploded in popularity, ultimately leading both executives to resign from Astronomer.

Paltrow kicks things off by introducing herself as someone who\u2019s been \u201chired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer.\u201d She then promises to answer the \u201cmost common\u201d questions asked about the company \u2014 but when the briefly glimpsed, half-typed questions are all about you-know-what, Paltrow remains cheerfully, and resolutely, on-message.",
