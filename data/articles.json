Paltrow was, of course, previously married to Coldplay singer Chris Martin. And it was at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts that the company\u2019s CEO Andy Byron and chief people officer Kristin Cabot were apparently caught dancing together on the \u201ckiss cam.\u201d When Byron and Cabot (who are reportedly married to other people) awkwardly tried to hide from the camera, Martin joked, \u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy.\u201d Footage of the exchange exploded in popularity, ultimately leading both executives to resign from Astronomer. In announcing Byron\u2019s resignation, the company said, \u201cOur leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.\u201d Astronomer\u2019s statement also nodded at the fact that the company had suddenly become famous for reasons having nothing to do with its product: \u201cWhile awareness of our company may have changed overnight, our product and our work for our customers have not.\u201d Its new marketing video has a similar message, attempting to refocus the conversation on Astronomer\u2019s technology, while winkingly acknowledging why that might be a challenge. Paltrow kicks things off by introducing herself as someone who\u2019s been \u201chired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer.\u201d She then promises to answer the \u201cmost common\u201d questions asked about the company \u2014 but when the briefly glimpsed, half-typed questions are all about you-know-what, Paltrow remains cheerfully, and resolutely, on-message.

When reached by TechCrunch, Allianz Life spokesperson Brett Weinberg confirmed the breach. \u201cOn July 16, 2025, a malicious threat actor gained access to a third-party, cloud-based CRM system used by Allianz Life,\u201d referring to a customer relationship management (CRM) database containing information on its customers. \u201cThe threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life\u2019s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,\u201d the spokesperson said. The company disclosed the data breach on Saturday in a legally required filing with Maine\u2019s attorney general but did not immediately provide a number of how many Allianz Life customers are affected. According to the spokesperson, Allianz Life has 1.4 million customers. Its parent company, Allianz, has more than 125 million customers worldwide. Allianz Life said it notified the FBI and added it had \u201cno evidence\u201d that any other systems on its network were compromised. The insurance giant would not say if it had received any communication from the hackers, such as a ransom note. The company also would not attribute the breach to a hacking group. Allianz Life is the latest company in the past month to have been hacked during a wave of data breaches targeting the wider insurance industry, including Aflac, a major provider of supplementary health insurance. Security researchers at Google said in June that they were \u201caware of multiple intrusions\u201d across the insurance sector attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and techniques that rely on social engineering methods, such as deceptively calling and tricking help desks into granting them access to a company\u2019s network. Prior to targeting insurance companies, the Scattered Spider hackers were seen targeting the U.K. retail industry, as well as the aviation and transportation sectors, and are historically known for hacks targeting Silicon Valley technology giants. Per the Maine filing, Allianz plans to begin notifying affected individuals around August 1. Do you know more about the Allianz Life cyberattack? Are you an affected customer or employee?

The move, the company said, was in response to a campaign by Collective Shout (an advocacy group that has previously criticized video games, rap music, and lingerie commercials) targeting both Itch.io and Steam for selling \u201cNo Mercy,\u201d a game that depicts rape and incest. In an open letter addressed to executives at PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and other payment processors, Collective Shout said that games \u201cendorsing men\u2019s sexualised abuse and torture of women and girls fly in the face of efforts to address violence against women.\u201d \u201cWe do not see how facilitating payment transactions and deriving financial benefit from these violent and unethical games, is consistent with your corporate values and mission statements,\u201d the organization added. The campaign appears to have worked, with Steam saying earlier this month that it would ban games that \u201cmay violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam\u2019s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers.\u201d Similarly, Itch.io said, \u201cTo ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.\u201d It also said that \u201cNo Mercy\u201d had been \u201ctemporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April,\u201d and that \u201cthe situation developed rapidly,\u201d forcing the company to \u201cact urgently to protect the platform\u2019s core payment infrastructure,\u201d without providing advanced notice to creators.

After the audit, Itch.io said NSFW game creators will be required to confirm that their content is allowed under the policies of their payment processors linked to their account. On social media, users criticizing Itch.io\u2019s decision noted that its current terms declare that adult content violations are \u201cpermanent with no chance of appeal\u201d and that any funds in an offending account \u201cwill not be eligible for payout\u201d \u2014 or as one developer put it, \u201cIf you violate the rules, we take all your money.

After selling just the Chevy Bolt for years, a wave of new models \u2014 now up to 17 fully electrified vehicles \u2014 has pushed the automaker into second place in the U.S. behind Tesla. How did it get there? With a little help from a Tesla veteran. GM board member Jon McNeill was president of Tesla during the development and introduction of the Model 3, a crucial period of the company\u2019s growth. One of the things he credits for Tesla\u2019s success is how Elon Musk ran product meetings. \u201cNo slides was our first rule,\u201d McNeill told the audience earlier this month at TC All Stage in Boston. \u201cYou have to be reviewing real product.\u201d Every week, senior leadership would sit down with product leaders to review their progress. The practice was inspired by an encounter Musk had with Steve Jobs, McNeill said. \u201cThere was this belief that I think is true: Steve Jobs didn\u2019t have a ton of time or patience for Elon in the early days. And early in the early days, Elon would try to chase Steve down at events and parties in Silicon Valley for advice. And Steve didn\u2019t like Elon, and so would often turn his back to him when he approached him. \u201cBut one night, Elon got lucky and said, \u2018Steve, if you had one piece of advice for me as a young entrepreneur\u2019 \u2014 he had just done PayPal and was joining the team at Tesla \u2014 \u2018what would that be?\u2019 Steve said, \u2018Elon, you\u2019re now in the hardware business, but the hardware business is a lot like the software business. If you want to be successful in business, you have to get one thing right, and that is, you have to have a perfect product. And if the product is beautiful, it will sell itself.\u2019\u201d Techcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW Musk took that to heart, McNeill said, and the concept of a perfect product became central to product development at Tesla. \u201cThe thing we were looking for first of all was surprise and delight. Like, are we doing something that is going to just make somebody go wow or laugh or have fun? \u201cCrazy example of that is the fart button,\u201d McNeill said, referring to a software button labeled \u201cEmissions Testing Mode\u201d that would simulate flatulence through the car\u2019s speakers. The company also prized minimalism, which on the software side meant keeping functions accessible in fewer than two taps on the screen. \u201cIt has to be a kind of a no-brainer for the average user. Then we would double back the designer \u2014 the lead designer was always in the room \u2014 and then we would say, OK, Franz, now make it beautiful.\u201d Meetings like those, where the actual product was reviewed, not a mock-up, helped preserve Tesla\u2019s culture as it grew, McNeill said. \u201cYou can imagine the culture that gets communicated when people are bringing their A game to the CEO every week. Because you\u2019re not going to bring your B game to the CEO \u2014 especially that CEO, because he\u2019s going to fire you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat keeps that company on a one-week cadence of innovation. Every week they\u2019re making progress because of the product reviews.\u201d McNeill left Tesla in early 2018. In 2022, he was added to the board at GM. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m most ",

Zhao contributed to several of OpenAI\u2019s largest breakthroughs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4, and the company\u2019s first AI reasoning model, o1. \u201cI\u2019m excited to share that Shengjia Zhao will be the Chief Scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads Friday. \u201cShengjia co-founded the new lab and has been our lead scientist from day one. Now that our recruiting is going well and our team is coming together, we have decided to formalize his leadership role.\u201d Zhao will set a research agenda for MSL under the leadership of Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of Scale AI who was recently hired to lead the new unit. We are excited to announce that @shengjia_zhao will be the Chief Scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs!Shengjia is a brilliant scientist who most recently pioneered a new scaling paradigm in his research. He will lead our scientific direction for our team.Let's go \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/D93KQWIvFl\u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) July 25, 2025 Wang, who does not have a research background, was viewed as a somewhat unconventional choice to lead an AI lab. The addition of Zhao, who is a reputable research leader known for developing frontier AI models, rounds out the leadership team. To further fill out the unit, Meta has hired several high-level researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Safe Superintelligence, Apple, and Anthropic, as well as pulling researchers from Meta\u2019s existing Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab and generative AI unit. Zuckerberg notes in his post that Zhao has pioneered several breakthroughs, including a \u201cnew scaling paradigm.\u201d The Meta CEO is likely referencing Zhao\u2019s work on OpenAI\u2019s reasoning model, o1, in which he is listed as a foundational contributor alongside OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. Meta currently doesn\u2019t offer a competitor to o1, so AI reasoning models are a key area of focus for MSL. The Information reported in June that Zhao would be joining Meta Superintelligence Labs, alongside three other influential OpenAI researchers \u2014 Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, and Hongyu Ren. Meta has also recruited\u00a0Trapit Bansal, another OpenAI researcher who worked on AI reasoning models with Zhao, as well as three employees from OpenAI\u2019s Zurich office who worked on multimodality. Zuckerberg has gone to great lengths to set MSL up for success. The Meta CEO has been on a recruiting spree to staff up his AI superintelligence lab, which has entailed sending personal emails to researchers and inviting prospects to his Lake Tahoe estate. Meta has reportedly offered some researchers eight- and nine-figure compensation packages, some of which are \u201cexploding offers\u201d that expire in a matter of days.

According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the AI industry hasn\u2019t yet figured out how to protect user privacy when it comes to these more sensitive conversations, because there\u2019s no doctor-patient confidentiality when your doc is an AI. The exec made these comments on a recent episode of Theo Von\u2019s podcast, This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. In response to a question about how AI works with today\u2019s legal system, Altman said one of the problems of not yet having a legal or policy framework for AI is that there\u2019s no legal confidentiality for users\u2019 conversations. \u201cPeople talk about the most personal sh** in their lives to ChatGPT,\u201d Altman said. \u201cPeople use it \u2014 young people, especially, use it \u2014 as a therapist, a life coach; having these relationship problems and [asking] \u2018what should I do?\u2019 And right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor about those problems, there\u2019s legal privilege for it. There\u2019s doctor-patient confidentiality, there\u2019s legal confidentiality, whatever. And we haven\u2019t figured that out yet for when you talk to ChatGPT.\u201d This could create a privacy concern for users in the case of a lawsuit, Altman added, because OpenAI would be legally required to produce those conversations today. \u201cI think that\u2019s very screwed up. I think we should have the same concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever \u2014 and no one had to think about that even a year ago,\u201d Altman said. The company understands that the lack of privacy could be a blocker to broader user adoption. In addition to AI\u2019s demand for so much online data during the training period, it\u2019s being asked to produce data from users\u2019 chats in some legal contexts. Already, OpenAI has been fighting a court order in its lawsuit with The New York Times, which would require it to save the chats of hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users globally, excluding those from ChatGPT Enterprise customers.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW In a statement on its website, OpenAI said it\u2019s appealing this order, which it called \u201can overreach.\u201d If the court could override OpenAI\u2019s own decisions around data privacy, it could open the company to further demand for legal discovery or law enforcement purposes. Today\u2019s tech companies are regularly subpoenaed for user data in order to aid in criminal prosecutions. But in more recent years, there have been additional concerns about digital data as laws began limiting access to previously established freedoms, like a woman\u2019s right to choose. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, for example, customers began switching to more private period-tracking apps or to Apple Health, which encrypted their records. Altman asked the podcast host about his own ChatGPT usage, as well, given that Von said he didn\u2019t talk to the AI chatbot much due to his own privacy concerns. \u201cI think it makes sense \u2026 to really want the privacy clarity before you use [ChatGPT] a lot \u2014 like the legal clarity,\u201d Altman said.

The company plans to spin off its Network and Edge group, which is responsible for making chips for the telecom industry, as originally reported by CRN. Intel will be an anchor investor in the stand-alone business and will seek outside capital. Intel was rumored to be looking for a buyer for its Network and Edge group in May. This business produced $5.8 billion in revenue in 2024. This strategy seems similar to the company\u2019s decision to spin off RealSense, its former stereoscopic imaging technology business, earlier this month. Intel decided to spin RealSense out during former CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s tenure and the company struck out on its own with $50 million in venture funding.

Citing a PowerPoint presentation dated July 1, The Post reports that the DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool is supposed to analyze around 200,000 federal regulations and identify the ones that are no longer required by law, with the goal of eliminating half those regulations by the first anniversary of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to office. It seems this work is already underway, with the presentation declaring the tool has already been used to review regulations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to write \u201c100% of deregulations\u201d at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A White House spokesperson told The Post that \u201cno single plan has been approved or greenlit\u201d but praised the DOGE team as \u201cthe best and brightest in the business.\u201d This is just the latest AI tool developed by DOGE (led in the early months of the Trump administration by Elon Musk), including one reportedly error-prone tool that would hallucinate the size of Veterans Affairs contracts.

Follow Hong Kong \u2014 The United States and China are poised to start a fresh round of talks in Sweden, aiming to extend a temporary trade truce that held back triple-digit tariffs while the world\u2019s two biggest economies try to broker a lasting deal. Delegations led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will convene in Stockholm on Monday before the current deadline expires on August 12. Ahead of the talks, Bessent said an extension is \u201clikely\u201d and that \u201ctrade is in a very good place with China.\u201d It will be the rivals\u2019 third European get-together in as many months, during which they have alternately feuded and negotiated, after slapping each other with sky-high tariffs that threatened to cut off all trade. Washington and Beijing reached a 90-day truce at a May meeting in Geneva, then pulled it back from the brink of collapse with further talks in London in June. The Stockholm talks may offer clues as to how much longer that detente can hold \u2013 and whether the two countries can further bring down remaining tariffs and address other thorny issues such as tech restrictions. They follow US President Donald Trump\u2019s recent flurry of trade deals with the United Kingdom, Japan, the European Union, and other trade partners, part of the global tariff war he launched earlier this year.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Tariffs European Union Prescription drugs See all topics Facebook Tweet Email Link Link Copied! Follow The United States and the European Union avoided the worst-case scenario: a damaging, all-out trade war between allies that threatened to raise prices on a large number of goods and slow two of the world\u2019s largest economies. The framework delivered a sense of relief for both sides \u2013 but few are cheering the arrangement itself. The agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on most European goods entering the United States, is higher than the 10% tariff Trump put in place on April 2 and significantly higher than the average of around 1.2% from before Trump\u2019s presidency. But it\u2019s significantly less than the enormous numbers Trump had been threatening if an agreement wasn\u2019t reached. A deal with the United States felt like an impossibility in late May. Frustrated by a lack of progress in negotiations with the 27-member European Union, Trump on May 24 told the world he was done talking to some of America\u2019s strongest allies. \u201cOur discussions with them are going nowhere!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a deal,\u201d he said later that day in the Oval Office. \u201cWe\u2019ve set the deal \u2014 it\u2019s at 50%.\u201d The statement \u2014 and the shockingly high tariff threat \u2014 stunned European trade negotiators and rallied Europe\u2019s leaders into action.

Follow: Tech giants See your latest updates Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg looks on before the luncheon on the inauguration day of President Donald Trump's second term in Washington, DC, January 20, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters/File New York CNN \u2014 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is on a mission for his company to be the first to reach so-called artificial superintelligence \u014c\u0106\u00f6 generally considered to mean AI that\u014c\u0106\u00d6s better than all humans at all knowledge work. It\u014c\u0106\u00d6s a nebulous and likely far-out concept that some analysts say may not immediately benefit the company\u014c\u0106\u00d6s core business. Yet Zuckerberg is shelling out huge sums to build an all-star team of researchers and engineers to beat OpenAI and other rivals to it. Zuckerberg\u014c\u0106\u00d6s recruiting spree, which has reportedly included multimillion-dollar pay packages to lure top talent away from key rivals, has kicked off a talent race within the AI industry. Last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed Meta was offering his employees $100 million signing bonuses to switch companies. And just this week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai was asked during an earnings call about his company\u014c\u0106\u00d6s status in the AI talent war, a sign that Wall Street is now also invested in the competition. The stakes are high for Zuckerberg \u014c\u0106\u00f6 after Meta\u014c\u0106\u00d6s pivot to the metaverse fell flat, he\u014c\u0106\u00d6s reoriented the company around AI in hopes of being a leader in the next transformational technology wave. The company has invested billions in data centers and chips to power its AI ambitions that it\u014c\u0106\u00d6s now under pressure to deliver on. Unlike other tech gia",

Follow New York \u2014 Some Muslim and Middle Eastern tech founders and leaders are among people protesting a prominent venture capitalist\u2019s recent comments blasting New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. They say when Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire called Mamdani an \u201cIslamist\u201d who \u201ccomes from a culture that lies about everything\u201d earlier this month, it shined a light on what they say is pervasive Islamophobia in their industry. Maguire earlier this month made those statements \u2013 which had 5.6 million views on X, as of July 23 \u2013 in reaction to a New York Times report that Mamdani marked his ethnicity as both \u201cAsian\u201d and \u201cBlack or African American\u201d on his 2009 application to Columbia University. Maguire has since continued to double down on social media, posting that Mamdani defends terrorists, raising inflammatory claims about his father, and claiming that both of them are \u201cso excited\u201d for a third Intifada. CNN has reached out to Mahmood Mamdani, Zohran Mamdani\u2019s father. Maguire\u2019s initial remarks on July 4 immediately drew backlash from the tech community as well as supporters of Mamdani. More than 1,100 people have signed an open letter to Sequoia on July 9 condemning Maguire\u2019s comments and demanding the venture capital firm apologize and take disciplinary action against him.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Corporate news Investing Stocks See all topics Facebook Tweet Email Link Link Copied! Follow New York \u2014 Intel said Thursday it has mostly completed plans it announced last quarter to cut 15% of its workforce, as the struggling chipmaker attempts a turnaround. The layoffs, tucked in Intel\u2019s second quarter earnings report, marked one of the first major decisions by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over the company\u2019s top job in March. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time, but we see clear opportunities to enhance our competitive position, improve our profitability and create long-term shareholder value,\u201d Tan said in a press release announcing the earnings results. Intel shares (INTC) rose 3% in after-hours trading following the news, although it posted a quarterly net loss of $2.9 billion, nearly double its loss during the same period in the prior year. The stock is up nearly 12% since the start of this year, suggesting that while Intel\u2019s future is far from certain, investors have confidence in Tan. Intel said the staff reduction is \u201cdesigned to create a faster-moving, flatter and more agile organization.\u201d The company reported having 108,900 employees as of the end of 2024 across Intel and its subsidiaries, which include autonomous driving company Mobileye. The company said it plans to end 2025 with 75,000 employees in its core Intel division \u2014 not including subsidiaries \u2014 as a result of \u201cworkforce reductions and attrition.
