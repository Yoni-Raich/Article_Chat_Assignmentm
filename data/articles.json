Paltrow was, of course, previously married to Coldplay singer Chris Martin. And it was at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts that the company\u2019s CEO Andy Byron and chief people officer Kristin Cabot were apparently caught dancing together on the \u201ckiss cam.\u201d When Byron and Cabot (who are reportedly married to other people) awkwardly tried to hide from the camera, Martin joked, \u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy.\u201d Footage of the exchange exploded in popularity, ultimately leading both executives to resign from Astronomer. In announcing Byron\u2019s resignation, the company said, \u201cOur leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.\u201d Astronomer\u2019s statement also nodded at the fact that the company had suddenly become famous for reasons having nothing to do with its product: \u201cWhile awareness of our company may have changed overnight, our product and our work for our customers have not.\u201d Its new marketing video has a similar message, attempting to refocus the conversation on Astronomer\u2019s technology, while winkingly acknowledging why that might be a challenge. Paltrow kicks things off by introducing herself as someone who\u2019s been \u201chired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer.\u201d She then promises to answer the \u201cmost common\u201d questions asked about the company \u2014 but when the briefly glimpsed, half-typed questions are all about you-know-what, Paltrow remains cheerfully, and resolutely, on-message.
